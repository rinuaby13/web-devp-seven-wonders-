				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>Chichen Itza was a Mayan city on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Although it’s an important tourist attraction, Chichen Itza also remains an active archeological site. New discoveries are still being unearthed in the area, providing even more insight into the culture and accomplishments of the Mayan people, who ruled much of present-day Mexico and Central America prior to the arrival of European colonists. Chichen Itza was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 and, in 2007, it was voted in a global survey as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.<p>

				<h4>History</h4>
				<p>Chichen Itza was built in an area of rough terrain that was leveled in order to accommodate larger structures, including, most notably, El Castillo (“the castle”), a pyramid structure that, thanks to restoration efforts on the part of the Mexican government, still stands today.archeologists believe the Mayans painted many of the buildings in bright colors, including reds, greens and blues.Researchers found that the human remains had bone marks and other wounds indicating that they were killed before being thrown into the cenote.<br>Although the fall of Mayan civilization is widely attributed to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, and the European colonialists that followed the famous explorer, Chichen Itza may well have lost its place as an important city in the region long before then.</p>

				<h4>Chichen Itza Today</h4>
				<p>A number of important structures of the original city remain standing, some thanks to restoration efforts on the part of the Mexican government. Among them:</p>
				<p><b>El Castillo:</b> Also known as the Temple of Kukulkan, named for a Mayan deity that appears as a feathered serpent.<br><b>The Great Ball Court:</b> Just to the northwest of El Castillo, this structure was used for sport—primarily a team game using a ball.<br><b>The North Temple: </b>Also called the Temple of the Bearded Man, this small building is adjacent to the Great Ball Court and features a carving on its inner walls.<br><b> The Steam Bath: </b>This structure features a water bath and steam chamber operated by using heated stones.</p>
